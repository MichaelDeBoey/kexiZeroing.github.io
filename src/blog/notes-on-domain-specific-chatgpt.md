## What are Vector Embeddings?
Vector embeddings are central to many NLP, recommendation, and search algorithms. We create vector embeddings, which are just lists of numbers, to perform various operations with them. A whole paragraph of text or any other object can be reduced to a vector.

There is something special about vectors that makes them so useful. This representation makes it possible to translate semantic similarity as perceived by humans to proximity in a vector space. In other words, when we represent real-world objects and concepts such as images, audio recordings, news articles, and user profiles as vector embeddings, the semantic similarity of these objects and concepts can be quantified by how close they are to each other as points in vector spaces.

<img alt="sentence_embeddings" src="https://raw.gitmirror.com/kexiZeroing/blog-images/main/008vOhrAly1hcc5elwuuoj313s0e075k.jpg" width="550" />

We train models to translate objects to vectors. A deep neural network is a common tool for training such models. The resulting embeddings are usually high dimensional (up to two thousand dimensions) and dense (all values are non-zero). For text data, models such as Word2Vec, GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), and BERT transform words, sentences, or paragraphs into vector embeddings. Images can be embedded using models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Tokens and Embeddings
Tokens are the basic units of data processed by LLMs. In the context of text, a token can be a word, part of a word (subword), or even a character — depending on the tokenization process.

In the context of GPT, each piece of text is represented by the ID of the corresponding token in the final vocabulary. If a word is not in the vocabulary, it’s broken down into smaller tokens that are in the vocabulary. The key point is that the assignment of token IDs is not arbitrary but based on the frequency of occurrence and combination patterns in the language data the model was trained on.

```
# Online playground for OpenAPI tokenizers: https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app
# Tokenizer - OpenAI API: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

"Apple is a fruit"

-> ['Apple', ' is', ' a', ' fruit']
-> [32352, 382, 261, 15310]
```

```js
// npm install js-tiktoken
// This is a pure JS port of the original tiktoken library.

import { Tiktoken } from "js-tiktoken/lite";
import o200k_base from "js-tiktoken/ranks/o200k_base";

const enc = new Tiktoken(o200k_base);
assert(enc.decode(enc.encode("hello world")) === "hello world");
```

> Language models don't see text like you and I, instead they see a sequence of tokens. Byte pair encoding (BPE) is a way of converting text into tokens used in GPT.
> - It's reversible and lossless, so you can convert tokens back into the original text.
> - It compresses the text: the token sequence is shorter than the bytes corresponding to the original text. On average, in practice, each token corresponds to about 4 bytes.
> - It attempts to let the model see common subwords. For instance, "ing" is a common subword in English, so BPE encodings will often split "encoding" into tokens like "encod" and "ing" (instead of e.g. "enc" and "oding"). Because the model will then see the "ing" token again and again in different contexts, it helps models generalise and better understand grammar.
> - It ensures that the most common words are represented as a single token while the rare words are broken down into two or more subword tokens. (Looking for the most frequent pairing, merge them, and perform the same iteration again and again until we reach our token limit or iteration limit.)

Embeddings are advanced vector representations of tokens. They try to capture the most nuance, connections, and semantic meanings between tokens. Each embedding is generally a series of real numbers on a vector space computed by a neural network. They are the “real inputs” of LLMs.

If you load a model from libraries, the embedding table is included automatically as part of the model’s weights. The model looks up each token ID in the embedding table (Token Embedding Matrix) to get token embeddings. These are token-level embeddings. To get an embedding for the whole sentence, you need to combine these token embeddings into one vector that represents the full sentence, which yields a sentence-level embedding.

> Token embeddings alone do not capture word order, models add positional information (Position Embedding Matrix) to embeddings. In general, we use the postion in the prompt to define a samll offset to the token's embeddings to slightly move it in the embedding space.

```py
from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embedded_query = embeddings.embed_query("Who is Mary's sister?")

print(f"Embedding length: {len(embedded_query)}") # Embedding length: 1536
print(embedded_query) # [-0.0013594045786472937, -0.03437049808954925, ...]
```

In data analysis, *cosine similarity* is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors defined in an inner product space. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths.

### Self Attention Mechanism
Tokenaizer -> Embedding (capture semantic meaning) -> Attention (capture contextual meaning)

Embeddings alone don't distinguish between words with multiple meanings. Embedding table assigns a signle vector regardless of the context. This is where self-attention comes in. Self attention mechanism transforms semantic representations into context-aware representations making words are understood in the context of the sentence.

- Query: Do you have anything useful for me
- Key: Here is what I can offer
- Value: Here is the actual information if we match

## Storing embeddings in Postgres with pgvector
How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly? For searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.

[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is an open-source vector similarity search for Postgres. Once we have generated embeddings on multiple texts, it is trivial to calculate how similar they are using vector math operations like cosine distance. A perfect use case for this is search. Your process might look something like this:

1. Pre-process your knowledge base and generate embeddings for each page.
2. Store your embeddings.
3. Build a search page that prompts your user for input.
4. Take user's input, generate a one-time embedding, then perform a similarity search against your pre-processed embeddings.
5. Return the most similar pages to the user.

`pgvector` introduces a new data type called `vector`. We create a column named `embedding` with the `vector` data type. The size of the vector defines how many dimensions the vector holds. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model outputs 1536 dimensions, so we will use that for our vector size. We also create a text column named `content` to store the original document text that produced this embedding. Depending on your use case, you might just store a reference (URL or foreign key) to a document here instead.

```sql
create table documents (
  id bigserial primary key,
  content text,
  embedding vector (1536)
);
```

ChatGPT doesn't just return existing documents. It's able to assimilate a variety of information into a single, cohesive answer. To do this, we need to provide GPT with some relevant documents, and a prompt that it can use to formulate this answer.

One of the biggest challenges of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` completion model is the 4000 token limit. This makes it challenging if you wanted to prompt GPT-3 to answer questions about your own custom knowledge base that would never fit in a single prompt. Embeddings can help solve this by splitting your prompts into a two-phased process:

1. Query your embedding database for the most relevant documents related to the question.
2. Inject these documents as context for GPT-3 to reference in its answer.

```js
// https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector

// Generate a one-time embedding for the query itself
const embeddingResponse = await openai.createEmbedding({
  model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
  input,
})

const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data.data

// Fetching whole documents for this simple example.
// `match_documents` is a function to perform similarity search over embeddings
const { data: documents } = await supabaseClient.rpc('match_documents', {
  query_embedding: embedding,
  match_threshold: 0.78, // Choose an appropriate threshold for your data
  match_count: 10, // Choose the number of matches
})

const tokenizer = new GPT3Tokenizer({ type: 'gpt3' })
let tokenCount = 0
let contextText = ''

// Concat matched documents
for (let i = 0; i < documents.length; i++) {
  const document = documents[i]
  const content = document.content
  const encoded = tokenizer.encode(content)
  tokenCount += encoded.text.length

  // Limit context to max 1500 tokens (configurable)
  if (tokenCount > 1500) {
    break
  }

  contextText += `${content.trim()}\n---\n`
}

const prompt = stripIndent`${oneLine`

### Domain-specific ChatGTP Starter App
[This starter app](https://github.com/gannonh/gpt3.5-turbo-pgvector) uses embeddings to generate a vector representation of a document, and then uses vector search to find the most similar documents to the query. The results of the vector search are then used to construct a prompt for GPT-3, which is then used to generate a response. The response is then streamed to the user.

Creating and storing the embeddings: See [pages/embeddings.tsx](https://github.com/gannonh/gpt3.5-turbo-pgvector/blob/master/pages/embeddings.tsx) and [pages/api/generate-embeddings.ts](https://github.com/gannonh/gpt3.5-turbo-pgvector/blob/master/pages/api/generate-embeddings.ts)
- Web pages are scraped, stripped to plain text and split into 1000-character documents.
- OpenAI's embedding API is used to generate embeddings for each document using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.
- The embeddings are then stored in a Supabase postgres table using `pgvector`.

Responding to queries: See [pages/api/docs.ts](https://github.com/gannonh/gpt3.5-turbo-pgvector/blob/master/pages/api/docs.ts) and [utils/OpenAIStream.ts](https://github.com/gannonh/gpt3.5-turbo-pgvector/blob/master/utils/OpenAIStream.ts)
- A single embedding is generated from the user prompt.
- That embedding is used to perform a similarity search against the vector database.
- The results of the similarity search are used to construct a prompt for GPT-3.
- The GTP-3 response is then streamed to the user.

```js
// generate and store embeddings from a list of input URLs
const { method, body } = req;
const { urls } = body;
const documents = await getDocuments(urls);

for (const { url, body } of documents) {
  const input = body.replace(/\n/g, " ");

  const embeddingResponse = await openAi.createEmbedding({
    model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
    input
  });

  const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data.data;

  await supabaseClient.from("documents").insert({
    content: input,
    embedding,
    url
  });
}

const docSize: number = 1000;  // embedding doc sizes

async function getDocuments(urls: string[]) {
  const documents = [];
  for (const url of urls) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const html = await response.text();
    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
    const articleText = $("body").text();

    let start = 0;
    while (start < articleText.length) {
      const end = start + docSize;
      const chunk = articleText.slice(start, end);
      documents.push({ url, body: chunk });
      start = end;
    }
  }
  return documents;
}
```

## GPT and LangChain Chatbot for PDF docs
[gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain](https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain) uses LangChain and Pinecone to build a chatbot for large PDF docs. Convert your PDF to embeddings:

```js
// https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain/blob/main/scripts/ingest-data.ts

/* load raw docs from the pdf file in the directory */
// https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/file_loaders/pdf
const loader = new PDFLoader(filePath);
const rawDocs = await loader.load();

});
const docs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(rawDocs);

const pinecone = new PineconeClient();
await pinecone.init({
  environment: process.env.PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT,
  apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY,
});
// An index is the highest-level organizational unit of vector data in Pinecone. 
// It accepts and stores vectors, serves queries over the vectors it contains, 
// and does other vector operations over its contents.
const index = pinecone.Index(PINECONE_INDEX_NAME); // change to your own index name

/* embed the PDF documents */
const chunkSize = 50;
for (let i = 0; i < docs.length; i += chunkSize) {
  const chunk = docs.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
  await PineconeStore.fromDocuments(
    index,
    chunk,
    embeddings,
  );
}
```

Several algorithms can facilitate the creation of a vector index. Their goal is to enable fast querying by creating a data structure that can be traversed quickly. They will commonly transform the representation of the original vector into a compressed form to optimize the query process.

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) creates a hierarchical, tree-like structure where each node of the tree represents a set of vectors. The edges between the nodes represent the similarity between the vectors. The algorithm starts by creating a set of nodes, each with a small number of vectors. The algorithm then examines the vectors of each node and draws an edge between that node and the nodes that have the most similar vectors to the one it has. When we query an HNSW index, it uses this graph to navigate through the tree, visiting the nodes that are most likely to contain the closest vectors to the query vector.

## Techniques beyond basic RAG
There is more to RAG than putting documents into a vector DB and adding an LLM on top. That can work, but it won’t always. The retrieval may return relevant information below our `top_k` cutoff. The metric we would measure here is **recall**, which measures how many relevant documents are retrieved out of the total number of relevant documents in the dataset. LLM recall degrades as we put more tokens in the context window.

A **reranking** model — also known as a cross-encoder — is a type of model that, given a query and document pair, will output a similarity score. We use this score to reorder the documents by relevance to our query. Search engineers have used rerankers in two-stage retrieval systems for a long time. In these two-stage systems, a first-stage model (an embedding model / bi-encoder) retrieves a set of relevant documents from a larger dataset. Then, a second-stage model (the reranker) is used to rerank those documents retrieved by the first-stage model. Note that rerankers are slow, and retrievers are fast.

1. bi-encoders must compress all of the possible meanings of a document into a single vector — meaning we lose information. Additionally, bi-encoders have no context on the query because we don’t know the query until we receive it (we create embeddings before user query time).
2. A cross-encoder is a type of neural network architecture used in NLP tasks, particularly in the context of sentence or text pair classification. Its purpose is to evaluate and provide a single score for a pair of input sentences, indicating the relationship or similarity between them. Cross-encoders are more accurate than bi-encoders but they don’t scale well, so using them to re-order a shortened list returned by semantic search is the ideal use case.

```py
# https://www.sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/pretrained_models.html
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
import torch

model = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2", default_activation_function=torch.nn.Sigmoid())
scores = model.predict([
    ("How many people live in Berlin?", "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers."),
    ("How many people live in Berlin?", "Berlin is well known for its museums."),
])
# => array([0.9998173 , 0.01312432], dtype=float32)
```

### Query Transformation
RAG systems often face challenges in retrieving the most relevant information, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous queries. These [query transformation techniques](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques/blob/main/all_rag_techniques/query_transformations.ipynb) address this issue by reformulating queries to better match relevant documents or to retrieve more comprehensive information.

1. Query Rewriting: Reformulates queries to be more specific and detailed.
2. Step-back Prompting: Generates broader queries for better context retrieval.
3. Sub-query Decomposition: Breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries.

### DeepSearch and DeepResearch
https://jina.ai/news/a-practical-guide-to-implementing-deepsearch-deepresearch/

- DeepSearch runs through an iterative loop of searching, reading, and reasoning until it finds the optimal answer.
- DeepResearch builds upon DeepSearch by adding a structured framework for generating long research reports.

RAG is about answering questions that fall outside of the knowledge baked into a model. The DeepSearch pattern offers a tools-based alternative to classic RAG: we give the model extra tools for running multiple searches and run it for several steps in a loop to try to find an answer.
