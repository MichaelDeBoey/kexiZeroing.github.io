### Historical context: The Path to MCP
Early AI assistants were limited to text generation, unable to interact with external tools or real-time data. The introduction of function calling and plugins in 2023 allowed models to execute code, browse the web, and interact with APIs, marking the shift toward AI agents. However, each integration was fragmented, requiring custom implementations for different tools, making scaling difficult.

MCP, introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, solves this problem by providing a unified protocol for AI-tool interactions. Instead of custom adapters for each tool, MCP allows developers to expose functionality once, making it accessible to any AI supporting MCP. It also eliminates the inefficiencies of tool-specific APIs by offering a structured, self-describing interface. This enables seamless, scalable AI-tool connectivity, much like how USB standardized device connections.

### MCP is not magic
MCP isn't magic â€” it's a standard way for AI to discover and use tools without learning every API's specific details. An MCP server is like a menu of tools. Each tool has a name, a description, a schema defining what info it needs, and the actual code that makes the API calls. AI applications (like Claude or Cline) can dynamically query these servers to execute tasks such as reading files, querying databases, or creating new integrations.

> How similar is this to tool calling? Tool calling lets LLMs invoke functions to interact with the real world, typically within the same process. MCP enables tool execution in a separate process, either locally or remotely, fully decoupling the server from the client.

### MCP server and client
MCP uses a client-server design where applications can connect to multiple resources. The system has three main parts:
- The Client Side: Making Requests
- The Communication Layer: The Standard Protocol
- The Server Side: Providing Resources

The **MCP client** is the program that's going to access the MCP servers. This might be Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other application that supports MCP. This host probably uses an LLM of some kind. That LLM will be able to call tools that are defined in the MCP server. See https://www.pulsemcp.com/clients

The **MCP server** is the server that's going to be running the tools that the host wants to call. This server could be running locally, or it could be running on a remote server. See https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers

The client connects to its server using a **transport**. This transport is responsible for sending messages between the client and the server. There are currently two supported transports. You can communicate via `stdio` - in other words, via the terminal. Or you can communicate through HTTP via server-sent events. This is useful if you want to run your server on a remote machine.

The **protocol** defines JSON message formats, based on JSON-RPC 2.0, for communication between client and server.

```json
// Client sends...
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "createGitHubIssue",
    "arguments": {
      "title": "My Issue",
      "body": "This is the body of my issue",
      "labels": ["bug"]
    }
  }
}

// Server sends back...
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Issue 143 created successfully!"
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

### The simplest MCP server

```ts
// npm i @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod

import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Weather Service",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

server.tool(
  "getWeather",
  { city: z.string().describe('The city to get the weather for') },
  async ({ city }) => {
    // await fetch('wheather API') 

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: `The weather in ${city} is sunny!`,
        },
      ],
    };
  },
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

Claude Desktop is the first MCP-compatible app, and it's the easiest way to test MCP. Open your Claude Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. After updating your configuration file, you need to restart Claude for Desktop. See the [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more details.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather-example": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code (only supports `stdio` transport), you can run it with a single command: `claude mcp add "weather-example" npx tsx "/path-to-the-file.ts"`. This tells Claude that in order to run the file, it should call `npx tsx /path-to-the-file.ts`.

```sh
claude mcp list
# No MCP servers configured.

claude mcp add "weather-example" npx tsx index.ts
# Added stdio MCP server weather-example...

claude mcp list
# weather-example: npx tsx index.ts

claude
# Actually run Claude Code
```

> Most MCP servers work "locally" (over a mechanism called `stdio`): you download a copy of the source code and run the code on your own computer. Servers rely on a command line tool either `npx` or `uvx` to download and run the server's code on your local machine. With both `npx` and `uvx` working, you're ready to use MCP servers with Claude Desktop.

### MCP servers over HTTP
The server can be hosted on the cloud, and the client can communicate with it via an HTTP connection. This is the mechanism called SSE, which enables an MCP server to be used over the internet. Most MCP servers today do not support this yet.

```js
// Still use the server we had in the previous example

import express from "express";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

const app = express();

let transport: SSEServerTransport | undefined =
  undefined;

app.get("/sse", async (req, res) => {
  transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
  await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req, res) => {
  if (!transport) {
    res.status(400);
    res.json({ error: "No transport" });
    return;
  }
  await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});
```

Run the server: `npx tsx ./path-to-file.ts`

### AI SDK MCP clients
The SDK supports connecting to MCP servers via either stdio (for local tools) or SSE (for remote servers). Once connected, you can use MCP tools directly with the AI SDK. The client exposes a `tools` method for retrieving tools from a MCP server.

```js
import { experimental_createMCPClient as createMCPClient } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: 'sse',
    url: 'https://my-server.com/sse',
  },
});

// The client's tools method acts as an adapter between MCP tools and AI SDK tools.
// https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling#using-mcp-tools
const response = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  tools: await mcpClient.tools(),
  prompt: 'Find products under $100',
});
```
