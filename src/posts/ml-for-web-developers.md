TensorFlow.js is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models. See more at https://www.tensorflow.org/js

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/qna"></script>
<script>
  const passage = "California is a state in the Western United States, located along the Pacific Coast."
  const question = "Where is California?"
  qna.load().then(model => {
    model.findAnswers(question, passage).then(answers => {
      console.log('Answers: ', answers);
    });
  });
</script>
```

Some examples just run in browsers:
- Recognizes emotions and changes design with content. The design will change based on your emotions.
- Smile to like something on social media instead of clicking the 'like' button.
- When you read a book on a computer, text changes size depending on your position in front of the screen.
- Are you sitting with correct posture right now? It can detect your posture and blurs a screen if itâ€™s poor.
