Hi there, I'm Kexi. I’m a software engineer and I have a great interest in web development.

[FE-Learning-notes](https://github.com/kexiZeroing/FE-Learning-notes) is used for self learning. Some documents and examples are copied from other places like MDN, Stack Overflow and GitHub. 1. The goal is to build a second brain. 2. The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews.

I admit that I'm not a typical geek who is so smart and addicted to the coding. The curiosity, job, and long-time habit drives me to keep living as a developer which means I need to learn all the time and the bad thing is I need to learn again and again since I would forget what I have learned before. I need to spend a long time doing actual work and solving issues to truly master a skill, to be more specific, reading documents, learning from blogs/videos with taking notes, and using them in everyday work.

I start to use Astro to build my blog here...
