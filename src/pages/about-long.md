Hi there, I'm Kexi. I’m a software engineer and I have a great interest in web development.

Most of the blog posts are used for self learning. Some documents and examples are copied from other places like MDN, Stack Overflow and GitHub. 
1. The goal is to build a second brain.
2. The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews.

I admit that I'm not a typical geek who is so smart and addicted to the coding. The curiosity, job, and long-time habit drives me to keep living as a developer which means I need to learn all the time and the bad thing is I need to learn again and again since I would forget what I have learned before. I need to spend a long time doing practical work and solving issues to truly master a skill, to be more specific, reading documents, learning from blogs/videos with taking notes, and using them in daily work.

I should remember what I have and lower the expectations. Take a relief, I'm just a normal person who wants to be happy, make money, and not feel a void. No one can know everything. I don't need to learn and acquire every aspect, so just keep going at my pace. Learning is not a direct and straight way; Interest, energy, time, and results are always fluctuating along with you.

Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience. To experience is to learn, and write about what you learn. The journey of rebuilding my blog with Astro out of curiosity starts...
