# Welcome to My Blog

## Notes
- The site is powered by Astro and deployed at GitHub Pages.
- Blog pictures are uploaded by [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo).
- Using CDN [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) or [statically](https://statically.io) to serve GitHub (or `raw.githubusercontent.com`) files is banned in China, so somehow find a way to try [GitMirror](https://gitmirror.com) as a replacement.
- Posts searching uses static search library [pagefind](https://pagefind.app).
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app) is a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions that allows visitors to leave comments and reactions on any website via GitHub.
- `/playground` page is designed for trying out ideas, testing concepts, and showcasing interesting implementations in a demonstrative way.
- `/series` page is my Super Simple Series projects, where I explore how web development concepts work under the hood. This series is all about learning by building.
- Use [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for tracking and product analytics.
- Refer to [Astro blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/4) and [blog-tutorial-demo](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/content-collections) to help me update to using a content collection.
- Refer to [Astro Shadcn UI Template](https://github.com/AREA44/astro-shadcn-ui-template) and [Official upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) to help me upgrade to [Tailwind CSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).
- Google doc exporting as PDF doesn't has a correct font if it's written in Chinese. You should use "print" and save as PDF. This [article](https://truxton2blog.com/google-docs-export-pdf-ugly-chinese-character-solution) explains this issue, which helps me a lot.
