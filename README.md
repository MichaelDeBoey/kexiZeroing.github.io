## Notes
- Site is powered by Astro.
- Blog pictures are uploaded by [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo).
- Using CDN [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) or [statically](https://statically.io) to serve GitHub (or `raw.githubusercontent.com`) files is banned in China. So found a way to try [GitMirror](https://gitmirror.com) as a replacement.

## About Astro
By default, [Astro](https://astro.build) ships HTML and CSS. No JavaScript at all. This is ideal for a substantial portion of the sites on the internet — most of these sites show us text and images without much interactivity or state. However, unlike previous tools that are against JavaScript, Astro fully embraces it. You can add any JavaScript you want, using any framework you want, and opt-in to shipping JS on the client side. Astro’s got you covered.
