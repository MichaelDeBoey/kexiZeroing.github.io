# Welcome to My Blog

Hi, I’m Kexi. I’m a web developer based in China, working mostly with Vue, React, and Node.js. I enjoy building clean and useful web apps, and I'm always learning and trying to improve.

I’m hoping to connect with more developers around the world, just to exchange ideas, maybe join some online or offline meetups. If there's a chance to collaborate or explore a remote opportunity, that would be amazing.

## Notes
- The site is powered by Astro and deployed at GitHub Pages.
- Blog pictures are uploaded by [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo).
- Using CDN [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) or [statically](https://statically.io) to serve GitHub (or `raw.githubusercontent.com`) files is banned in China, so somehow find a way to try [GitMirror](https://gitmirror.com) as a replacement.
- Posts searching uses static search library [pagefind](https://pagefind.app). An alternative library is [StaticSearch](https://publican.dev/tools/staticsearch).
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app) is a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions that allows visitors to leave comments and reactions on any website via GitHub.
- `/playground` page is designed for trying out ideas, testing concepts, and showcasing interesting implementations in a demonstrative way.
- `/series` page is my Super Simple Series projects, where I explore how web development concepts work under the hood. This series is all about learning by building.
- Use [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for tracking and product analytics.
- Refer to [Astro blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/4) and [blog-tutorial-demo](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/content-collections) to help me update to using a content collection.
- Refer to [Astro Shadcn UI Template](https://github.com/AREA44/astro-shadcn-ui-template) and [Official upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) to help me upgrade to [Tailwind CSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).
- Google doc exporting as PDF doesn't has a correct font if it's written in Chinese. You should use "print" and save as PDF. This [article](https://truxton2blog.com/google-docs-export-pdf-ugly-chinese-character-solution) explains this issue, which helps me a lot.
